2259,"One concerning parallel for Southampton would follow shortly afterwards, with the hosts again reduced to 10 men after Rob Jones controversially showed a straight red card to Vestergaard for denying Vardy a clear goalscoring opportunity, despite television replays showing the defender had won the ball before making any contact"
2260,"But, after limiting Leicester and the Premier League's man of the moment Kelechi Iheanacho to some sporadic half-chances, out-of-form Southampton instead took the lead after an hour when Iheanacho's handball allowed James Ward-Prowse to step up and beat Kasper Schmeichel from 12 yards"

2959,"But with Bamford's goal behind them, Leeds secured their first win in three games with a fine second from Dallas 12 minutes from time, before Raphinha beat McCarthy direct from a free-kick (84) to move the hosts up to 10th, and exceed their entire points tally from the last season they were at this level"

2963,"The decision to move him onto the left-wing against an out-of-position Bednarek at half-time made the real difference, however, and he ended providing the most key passes (4) of anyone on the pitch, creating superb chances for Llorente and Bamford"
2964,"Leeds' reputation as the Premier League's high-intensity, all-action side looked a more appropriate description of Southampton in the early minutes, who should have led when Jannik Vestergaard was left unmarked to head a gorgeous James Ward-Prowse free-kick wide"
2965,Southampton's best second-half opportunity game through another Vestergaard header
2966,"Before the break, Southampton had enjoyed the better of the game and were initially awarded a penalty for Diego Llorente's foul on Nathan Tella before it was overturned by VAR, and in the final minute of the half Che Adams was denied a goal from a free-kick which had been taken before Andre Marriner had blown his whistle"

2968,"After a slow start Leeds grew into the match and saw Roberts fire over when well-placed and Liam Cooper's rising effort from a free-kick turned over, before Adams tucked home Ward-Prowse's quick free-kick only to be denied as Marriner had blown his whistle marginally after the ball was first kicked"
2969,"Palace's two goals came from their only two shots on target - and touches in the Brighton box - in the whole game, with Benteke steering Andros Townsend's cross back across goal and beyond Robert Sanchez deep into second-half injury time to nick three points"
2970,"His close-range finish, his first for the club, had cancelled out Jean-Philippe Mateta's own debut goal for Palace before half-time, back-heeling Jordan Ayew's low ball past Sanchez for a wonderful opener"
2971,"A slow start at the Amex in one of the Premier League's more informal derbies was punctured 28 minutes in as Mateta, the latest Crystal Palace striker hoping to solve their attacking woes, deceived Robert Sanchez with a beautiful turn to backheel Ayew's low cross home with the first shot on target of the game"
2972,"With 52 seconds left of the five minutes added on, Townsend's run down the left flank and back-post cross found Benteke, who caught it perfectly to fire back across Sanchez and into the far corner for a winner both sides could barely believe come the full-time whistle"
2973,"""In what was often a thankless task in a game where Palace managed only three shots across 90 minutes, Ayew's running played a major part in their opener - beating Burn before providing the cross for Mateta's goal - but his work without the ball was just as important"
2974,"Even with another attacking player on the pitch, it was a Brighton defender who pulled them level nine minutes into the second period, as Veltman found himself well-placed to take a loose ball from a tackle on Welbeck to beat Guaita at his near post with a powerful effort"

3436,"An end-to-end game was unsurprisingly dominated territorially by Liverpool, with Spurs looking to hit them on the break, but only Mane's burst into the box and a tremendous save that followed from Lloris caused any real chance of note, and even then the Senegal winger would also have fallen foul of an offside call had he found the back of the net"
3437,"A goal behind and without Kane, Spurs' evening looked to be heading for the rocks when Alexander-Arnold fired home on the rebound when Lloris perhaps made tougher work of Mane's curling effort than he should have, but within another two minutes, Spurs pulled back within a goal as Hojbjerg connected brilliantly with Steven Bergwijn's ball to the edge of the box"

3477,"Some early fouls and high-intensity pressing from Sam Allardyce's visitors suggested they had not come to simply sit back and soak up pressure at the London Stadium, and instead Pereira should have tested Fabianski from the first real chance of the game, but turned Callum Robinson's lay-off well over"

3841,"An injury to Fabinho overshadowed Liverpool's unconvincing 2-0 Champions League win over Midtjylland, with Diogo Jota and Mo Salah on target"
3842,"But a match-ending injury to stand-in defender Fabinho on the half-hour mark would prove a bigger concern for the Reds, with Williams, who a year ago this week was starting in defence for Kidderminster in the National League North, his only available replacement"

3844,"It was little surprise Alexander-Arnold was at the heart of the move, timing his run from a one-two with Xherdan Shaqiri to perfection to stay onside before squaring for a simple Jota finish"
3845,"Liverpool's changed front three looked uncomfortable as a trio and it was Alexander-Arnold who looked most likely to create an opening, with Takumi Minamino missing a low cross altogether before Joel Andersson stopped another from reaching him after a good run from the Liverpool right-back"
3846,"Perhaps more cautious to protect the inexperienced defender, Liverpool looked more solid in the last throes of the opening period, and saw Jota and Minamino nod Alexander-Arnold crosses wide before going in goalless at the break"

4588,"Tottenham let in three goals in the first 15 minutes at Liverpool, came back to equalise in stoppage time, then conceded a 94th-minute winner to Diogo Jota as the Reds won a dramatic encounter 4-3 at Anfield"
4589,"But straight from the kick-off, Jota capitalised on Lucas Moura's poor back pass to finish past Fraser Forster and send Anfield into raptures"
4590,The visitors were also left aggrieved that matchwinner Jota was not given a red card for a very high foot on Oliver Skipp - which was only punished with a caution

4592,Tottenham interim boss Mason could not hide his anger at not seeing Jota sent off for his high challenge on Skipp

4601,Romero had let Diaz go for the tap-in and it was not long until the Spurs defender had his head in his hands once again
4602,"Team-mates such as Eric Dier, Heung-Min Son, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Davinson Sanchez have similar polarising performances in them, while newer players Pedro Porro and Cristian Romero both made errors for Liverpool's first three goals - then nearly ended up on the scoresheet in the second half"

4610,The pressure grew and grew as Aaron Hickey fired wide and Navas stopped Frank Onyeka's deflected effort on the goal line
4611,"At the other end, Brentford missed their best chance of the afternoon as Ethan Pinnock's long-range drive after a goalmouth scramble was well-saved low down by Navas, with Mikkel Damsgaard pouncing on the rebound, but the Brentford midfielder could only prod the ball straight at Navas from a yard out - and, minutes later, Forest were ahead"

4614,"But VAR checked whether Brentford striker Yoane Wissa was interfering with Navas' vision and while the technology deemed the forward to be onside, Cooper hinted that he may dispute the call"
4615,"""I hope I see it [an image where Wissa is definitely onside]"

4626," But back came West Ham again, with Nayef Aguerd nodding in to atone for his foul on Eze and set up a grandstand finale"
4627,"Palace were aggrieved not to be awarded a penalty in first-half stoppage time after Zaha was hauled down in the area by Vladimir Coufal, but referee Craig Pawson did point to the spot on 66 minutes after Aguerd was adjudged to have tugged Eze as he raced through on goal"

4629,"Roberto De Zerbi's side put defeats to Manchester United at Wembley and Nottingham Forest behind them in style, despite benching key players Kaoru Mitoma, Alexis Mac Allister and Moises Caicedo"
4630,"Welbeck continued the rout as he netted just three minutes into the second half and there was no let-up from De Zerbi as Mitoma, Mac Allister and Caicedo were all introduced"
4631," It was good and right to give Mitoma, Mac Allister, Caicedo one game to recover"
4632,"It got a lot worse for Wolves as Welbeck's downward header beat Jose Sa before the break and left Lopetegui furious on the touchline, having words with several of his players when they came over during an injury break"
4633,"Undav added the sixth with a delicate chip, but only after Max Kilman had been robbed of the ball inside his own area, as the Wolves defence continued to be run ragged"
4634,"Wolves looked like they were on Brighton's beach rather than at the Amex, their only chance of the half coming through a Matheus Nunes strike inside the box which Jason Steele did well to push away"
4635," Joelinton broke down the left and his cross-shot was parried by Jordan Pickford to Wilson, who scored his seventh goal in six matches against Everton"

4643,"Everton entered the second half knowing they had won just one of 18 Premier League games this term having conceded first, and they very nearly conceded a second within a minute of the restart as Joelinton fed Joe Willock down the left channel and his shot was cleared superbly off the line by Tarkowski"

4655,"The nerves emanating from the home crowd were audible and grew louder with every slip and misplaced pass, with Alex McCarthy - starting over Gavin Bazunu, who was dropped - failing to inspire confidence"
4656,"This only served to encourage Bournemouth, who swiftly hit their rivals with their second blow as Tavernier danced in from the right wing before guiding a shot past McCarthy and inside the far post"
4657,Jan Bednarek then got away with a blatant handball before Tavernier - who has been hampered by injuries in 2023 - left the field with his head in his hands after suffering a hamstring issue
4658,The hosts were then struck with their first body blow at half-time when inspirational captain James Ward-Prowse failed to appear for the second half due to illness

4683,It was more even after the interval with Emery introducing Bertrand Traore in an attacking move

4783," Iheanacho broke and found Vardy who skipped round Jose Sa, only for the goalkeeper to slip and bring him down"

5268," History repeated itself when Jarrod Bowen clumsily got the wrong side of Mitoma, who didn't need a second invitation to hit the deck"
5269,West Ham were happy to relinquish possession and wait for chances on the counter and Bowen should have levelled matters on 24 minutes when through one-on-one but Jason Steele blocked the effort away

5356,"The result was a welcome one for Spurs, who had lost their last two matches in all competitions and have manager Antonio Conte recuperating from surgery in Italy, while West Ham had to endure mocking chants from the home fans after a hugely disappointing performance that only adds to their relegation fears"

5421,Newcastle goalkeeper Nick Pope was then sent off for denying a goalscoring opportunity with a handball outside his box (22)
5422, Gakpo connected with Mo Salah's sumptuous dinked pass ahead of Pope to make it two goals in two having taken six games to score following his move from PSV in January

5442,"Arsenal started strongly, despite the absence of Partey, replaced by full debutant Jorginho, and after surviving a nervy moment when Haaland elected to cross rather than shoot from a Riyad Mahrez cross, the hosts created the first clear chance of the game, Nketiah heading wastefully wide from Oleksandr Zinchenko's diagonal cross"

5449,"Neto came for Joao Moutinho's corner but failed to claim it, with Dango Ouattara hacking the ball off the toes of Matheus Nunes - who was ready to poke home into an empty net"
5450," Matheus Cunha missed a header at the near post from Traore's brilliant run and cross, while the impressive Jack Stephens denied the same Wolves forward with a superb double block"
5451,"Before the goal, Bournemouth goalkeeper Neto did well to deny Pablo Sarabia and Adama Traore, while he tipped over Craig Dawson's late header from a corner - as the Cherries kept a first Premier League clean sheet away from home since 2019"

5459," Mo Salah broke the deadlock for Liverpool (36) just 16 seconds after Everton's James Tarkowski headed against the post from a corner as Liverpool opened up the visitors with a devastating counter, before Gakpo doubled their advantage from close-range (49) to put the game out of sight for the timid Toffees"

5471,"Ezri Konsa made a goalline block from Julian Alvarez and Mahrez scooped another glorious chance over the bar, but Villa continued to look dangerous at the other end, with Jhon Duran crashing a shot against Ederson's bar and Philippe Coutinho, another substitute, also threatening"
5472,"City continued to pin Villa back, with Calum Chambers subjected to a bruising first 45 minutes on his first Premier League start since August, and the hosts created a succession of other chances, Jack Grealish twice going close before Gundogan scored the second"

5491,But the introduction of Jonjo Shelvey for his Forest debut saw the visitors create a flurry of chances - which nearly led to an equaliser

5498,"""Solly March finally gave De Zerbi's dominant side the lead midway through the second half, but their advantage only lasted six minutes before Sanchez dropped a cross under no pressure, allowing James Tomkins to head in the equaliser from close range"
5499," In that respect, Sanchez fell way short of the mark at Selhurst Park"

5511,"Jones' move to hand full debuts to new arrivals' Paul Onuachu and Sulemana - Saints' brightest spark on the day - showed bravery but they lacked enough guile to get over the finish line, despite playing with an extra man for over an hour"

5513,"""Saints wrestled initial control of the tie during two manic first-half minutes, where Alcaraz broke the deadlock with a sweet strike that went in via the inside of the post (25) and Wolves midfielder Mario Lemina was dismissed for a second bookable offence (27)"
5514,Referee Jarred Gillett also played his part by showing former Saints midfielder Lemina two yellow cards - for a late challenge which was quickly followed up by a show of dissent - but even that couldn't provide the hosts with the competitive edge they needed to outwit their Midlands counterparts
5515,"Kane twice came close to scoring in quick succession after the hour, missing a low cross from Ivan Perisic at the back post and being denied by a big Ederson save"

6089,"Anthony Elanga should have made it 2-1 just before the hour mark, released through on goal by Lingard but denied by Faivre, and the topsy-turvy nature to the game continued as Meschack Elia struck wide at the other end from a Nemanja Matic error"
6090,"Anthony Elanga should have made it 2-1 just before the hour mark, released through on goal by Lingard but denied by Faivre, and the topsy-turvy nature to the game continued as Meschack Elia struck wide at the other end from a Nemanja Matic error"
6091,"Chances were exchanged in a goalless second half, as United gave senior debuts to 35-year-old Tom Heaton and 18-year-olds Charlie Savage, son of Robbie Savage, and Zidane Iqbal on a night where several fringe players given much-needed minutes"
6092,"Quentin Maceiras squandered another Young Boys chance shortly after, slicing a shot wide having been found ummarked 12 yards out, before Rangnick took his squad rotation to the next level, bringing on 35-year-old Tom Heaton for Dean Henderson for his first-ever senior Manchester United appearance having started at the club's academy"
6093,"Anthony Elanga should have made it 2-1 just before the hour mark, released through on goal by Lingard but denied by Faivre, and the topsy-turvy nature to the game continued as Meschack Elia struck wide at the other end from a Nemanja Matic error"
6094,"Quentin Maceiras squandered another Young Boys chance shortly after, slicing a shot wide having been found ummarked 12 yards out, before Rangnick took his squad rotation to the next level, bringing on 35-year-old Tom Heaton for Dean Henderson for his first-ever senior Manchester United appearance having started at the club's academy"
6095,"Young Boys began to find rhythm, forcing Dean Henderson into a stop from Jordan Siebatcheu, while at the other end Juan Mata somehow saw his goal-bound shot from 10 yards deflect off Fabian Lustenberger and then hit the foot of goalkeeper Guillaume Faivre"
6096,"Manchester City were beaten in their final Champions League group game 2-1 by managerless RB Leipzig, with Kyle Walker sent off late on"
6097,The visitors' evening went from bad to worse when Walker was shown a straight red card late on
6098, He cannot play in the last 16 and Kyle Walker is so important for us
6099,"However, their frustrating evening was compounded as Walker was sent off in the 82nd minute"
6100,"The referee then produced a straight red card, with Walker sent back to the dressing room 10 minutes early"
6101," There was a question of offside, but he was clearly on, as he sped away from John Stones"
6102, A sloppy pass from Stones allowed Forsberg to nip through before driving into the area
6103, Kevin De Bruyne and Jack Grealish also sent shots flashing across the face of goal for the visitors
6104,"Instead of galvanising Milan, the opener forced them further and further back, as Origi draw Mike Maignan into save before a drive from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain proved too hot for the goalkeeper, who spilled the ball to Salah, who dispatched a difficult rebound in effortless fashion"
6105,"Again, there was no reaction before the break or after the interval from Milan, whose performance belied their position as Serie A leaders, as Liverpool assumed a lead they would not surrender when Origi rekindled his Champions League scoring touch with a bullet header after Sadio Mane's drive was parried into his path by Maignan"
6106,"Alisson Becker produced a brilliant sprawling save to prevent Franck Kessie from snatching a late point for the hosts but not even that could salvage Milan's European season, which is now at an end after Atletico Madrid finished as runners-up behind Liverpool after winning 3-1 in Porto, who finished third and drop into the Europa League"
6107,"Milan left it late to throw caution to the wind but when they did they found Alisson in impenetrable mood, as his late smothering save prevented Kessie from snatching an undeserved late and ensured Liverpool's place in the history books"
6108,"With the lead secure, and with an eye on Saturday's visit of Steven Gerrard's Aston Villa, Klopp withdrew Salah and Mane with 26 minutes remaining, before late European debuts were handed to academy products Conor Bradley and Max Woltman"
6109, A lovely swinging cross from Neco Williams pinged wide off of Takumi Minamino's head - with the offside flag up again - before Mehdi Taremi's cross from the right was superbly cleared by Champions League debutant Tyler Morton
6110," Oxlade-Chamberlain sent an effort just wide, before Minamino had the ball in the back of the net, but again found himself flagged for offside"
6111,"But soon after, Porto lost their captain Pepe to injury, with the Portugal international having only just returned to the starting XI"
6112,Porto began quickly and the complexion of the match could have been so different if Otavio had fired home a glorious chance in the 12th minute
6113,"Lionel Messi and Neymar were both heavily involved as the visitors attacked from deep before Messi's deflected cross fell kindly for Mbappe, who fired through the legs of Ederson to give PSG the lead against the run of play"
6114,The hosts were given a warning just before the break when John Stones was caught in possession in the centre circle
6115,"There was no let up from City as they continued to pin PSG back and they hit the post through Ilkay Gundogan, although the flag was raised for offside, and Keylor Navas produced a fine save low to his right to deny Mahrez"
6116,Mahrez was heavily involved in the action for City in the first half and the visitors needed Achraf Hakimi to divert the Algerian's curled effort over the crossbar
6117,"Lionel Messi and Neymar were both heavily involved as the visitors attacked from deep before Messi's deflected cross fell kindly for Mbappe, who fired through the legs of Ederson to give PSG the lead against the run of play"
6118,Pep Guardiola's side were made to pay for their wastefulness early in the second half as Kylian Mbappe put the Ligue 1 leaders ahead against the run of play
6119,"""However, in the second half we saw what they can do with Lionel Messi, Neymar and Kylian Mbappe"
6120,PSG's Kylian Mbappe became the second youngest outfield player to reach 50 Champions League appearances in this match (after Cesc Fabregas)
6121," Neymar pounced before sliding the ball through for Mbappe, but the French striker's early shot flew over Ederson's crossbar"
6122,"Lionel Messi and Neymar were both heavily involved as the visitors attacked from deep before Messi's deflected cross fell kindly for Mbappe, who fired through the legs of Ederson to give PSG the lead against the run of play"
6123,"""However, in the second half we saw what they can do with Lionel Messi, Neymar and Kylian Mbappe"
6124," The action where Neymar was in front of the 'keeper and missed it, so they found from nothing… they are too good up front! We had to defend as a team"
6125,"Juventus were justifiably unhappy that his opener was allowed to stand given Ziyech's corner appeared to strike Rudiger on the hand, but the VAR check ruled in Chelsea's favour after Chalobah's rising drive had beaten Wojciech Szczesny"
6126, Szczesny was called into action to deny James soon after Silva's intervention and even Kante's withdrawal did not alter the complexion of the game
6127," Hudson-Odoi had a diagonal effort blocked by Matthijs de Ligt and Silva headed straight at Szczesny from a free-kick, but the hosts did not have to wait long to extend their lead"
6128,"The Blues lost N'Golo Kante to a knee injury in the first half, while Ben Chilwell was also forced off with a knee problem following a coming together with Adrien Rabiot in the second"
6129,"However, that miss was soon forgotten as United took the lead with just 12 minutes to go after good work by Fred, whose pressure on Etienne Capoue led to the ball falling to Ronaldo on the edge of the box and, with Rulli badly out of position, the Portuguese found the net with a nonchalant lob for his 140h goal in the competition and 799th in total for club and country"
6130,"However, in the second half it was Fred's intervention when pressurising Etienne Capoue that resulted in Cristiano Ronaldo's opener, and the 28-year-old was at it again late on when breaking up a Villarreal attack, before starting a counter which was finished off by Sancho to seal the victory"
6131,"The interim boss brought on Fernandes and the pacy Marcus Rashford in place of the disappointing Anthony Martial and Donny van de Beek midway through the second period, with United taking charge of the contest thereafter"
6132," Hans Vanaken forced a fine save from Ederson but when the ball was crossed back in by Charles de Ketelaere, Bernardo Silva's attempted clearance struck Stones and rebounded into his own goal"
6133,"Clement was hoping to secure the club's first victory against English opponents in European competition since February 1995 having failed to win any of their previous 13 matches, and it was De Ketelaere whose turn and shot drew a smart save from Ederson shortly before the break"
6134," Hans Vanaken forced a fine save from Ederson but when the ball was crossed back in by Charles de Ketelaere, Bernardo Silva's attempted clearance struck Stones and rebounded into his own goal"
6135,"Jack Grealish had Clinton Mata for company throughout the opening half but within two minutes of the second period, he drifted inside to cause damage as he was found centrally by Kyle Walker before he in turn slipped through Mahrez but Simon Mignolet rushed out to make a fine save with his feet"
6136," Hans Vanaken forced a fine save from Ederson but when the ball was crossed back in by Charles de Ketelaere, Bernardo Silva's attempted clearance struck Stones and rebounded into his own goal"
6137,"The positive of Thiago getting his first minutes since mid-September was tempered by the loss of Roberto Firmino, who limped off after replacing Mane, who had been booked, at the break"
6138,"Liverpool qualified for the last-16 of the Champions League and guaranteed top spot in Group B with two games to spare after a 2-0 win over ill-disciplined Atletico Madrid, who had Felipe sent off in the first half"
6139,"Unlike the previous meeting in Madrid, there was to be no reaction by Diego Simeone's men as Felipe was shown a straight red card on 36 minutes for a foul on Mane"
6140,Similar disciplinary problems were on show yet again though from the Spanish champions when Felipe kicked across the back of Mane's leg as he tried to launch a counter-attack
6141, Referee Makkelie deemed the offence worthy of violent conduct as Felipe was shown the red card - a decision perhaps influenced by Felipe's unwillingness to acknowledge the referee when being called to him
6142,"Liverpool somehow failed to extend their lead after the break with Joel Matip and Jota missing glorious chances while the returning Luis Suarez had a goal chalked off by VAR for offside, to the delight of the Anfield faithful"
6143,"You sensed the floodgates would open, but Malmo remained resolute with Erdal Rakip's speculative drive failing to trouble Edouard Mendy"
6144,"Chelsea last visited Malmo in 2019 en route to claiming the Europa League title, and they dominated possession as patient play involving Hudson-Odoi and Marcos Alonso resulted in Cesar Azpilicueta's low shot being fumbled around the post by goalkeeper Dahlin"
6145,Johan Dahlin twice denied Kai Havertz from point-blank range either side of the interval but the result means another victory for Chelsea without conceding
6146,"In front of a sell-out crowd of 20,000 supporters at the Swedbank Stadion, the hosts survived an early penalty appeal as Anel Ahmedhodzic left Havertz in a heap inside the box but referee Felix Brych was well placed to wave away the protests"
6147,"The Blues had lost only four of their last 23 games in Europe's premier cup competition, and Tuchel's men continued to probe as Dahlin was drawn into action once more when Havertz found Ziyech but his low shot was kept out by the feet of the Malmo stopper"
6148,Dahlin was enjoying his night and his heroics kept Malmo level as Havertz collected Ruben Loftus-Cheek's perfectly-weighted pass but the forward's dinked effort was smothered by the onrushing goalkeeper
6149,Tuchel's decision to switch wingers was vindicated as Havertz and Hudson-Odoi combined down the right to good effect before the latter's low cross was guided in by Ziyech at the far post
6150,Chelsea did come close to a second when another Ziyech corner was met by Thiago Silva but cleared off the line brilliantly by Ahmedhodzic before Dahlin resumed his battle with Havertz to deny the forward from Loftus-Cheek's through ball
6151,There was time for Tuchel to introduce Christian Pulisic in the final 15 minutes for his first appearance since August and only his third for Chelsea this season as the visitors saw out the game with minimum fuss
6152,"""""Tuchel will certainly have wanted his players to have been more clinical in front of goal, highlighted by Havertz's profligacy and even the rustiness of Pulisic as he missed a presentable chance albeit from an offside position with the final kick of the game"
6153,A fine one-touch move pulled United level at the end of a familiarly uninspiring first half when Bruno Fernandes' perfect backheel teed up Ronaldo to take a touch and beat Juan Musso from eight yards
6154,United pushed but could not find a way to test Musso until more Ronaldo brilliance in injury-time saw the veteran find the bottom corner with a 20-yard volley to earn another spectacular last-gasp result but raise more questions than answers for Solskjaer and his team
6155,"From there Atalanta looked to see out victory, with Musso barely tested by United in the final half-hour of the game"
6156,"Zapata fired a warning shot of the danger his pace would later pose when played in behind by Davide Zappacosta's long ball, which he lashed wide with Ilicic in space at the far post, shortly before United were dealt more defensive concerns as Raphael Varane was forced off by a hamstring injury"
6157," Fernandes, Ronaldo and Mason Greenwood took a touch each before Fernandes laid the ball off wonderfully for Ronaldo to level things up"
6158,Jorginho's double from the spot helped Chelsea romp to a 4-0 win over Malmo in a victory marred by injuries to strikers Romelu Lukaku and Timo Werner
6159,Chelsea's injury concerns worsened when Werner was forced off when he went down off the ball with what appeared a hamstring complaint
6160,"Werner teed up his replacement Havertz for a fine chance which he planted wide before the former, too, was forced off after he pulled up with a hamstring complaint before the break"
6161,"Without a recognised striker left among their squad, the makeshift partnership of Callum Hudson-Odoi and Kai Havertz then combined well for the German to add the Blues' third three minutes into the second period, before Jorginho rounded off the scoring with his second from 12 yards after Antonio Rudiger was bundled over in the area by Eric Larsson"
6162," Rudiger stayed forward from an attack and, after pressing captain Anders Christiansen, won the ball back, raced into the box and was felled by Larsson before he could get a shot away, allowing Jorginho to fire in his second of the night from the penalty spot"
6163,"There was a strong suggestion Nielsen should have been penalised for bundling over Jorginho in the box on the quarter-hour mark in an incident which left the referee unmoved, but he could not contemplate anything other than a penalty for the defender's scissor-challenge, reminiscent of Pascal Struijk's challenge on Harvey Elliott, on Lukaku"
6164,Ironically the striker's punishment was worse than the perpetrator's with Lukaku forced off minutes later while Nielsen escaped with a yellow card
6165,"Bruno Fernandes' flick played Fred in, who kept his composure and got past one challenge before bending his strike wide of the far post from close range"
6166,"However, United pulled level in the 75th minute when Fernandes' cross was flicked on by Edinson Cavani and the ball fell to Maguire, who swept home a fine finish at the far post"
6167, Jadon Sancho was decent when he came on as well
6168," Fernandes' first-time pass released Rashford, who slotted a right-footed shot home from a tight angleThe momentum was now with the home side and McTominay hit the post as United continued to push forward, but Atalanta remained a threat on the break, with De Gea forced into action with a fine double save to deny substitutes Duvan Zapata and Ruslan Malinovskyi"
6169,"Foden's inch-perfect through ball released Cancelo, who showed great composure to hold off Kamal Sowah's challenge before poking the ball through the legs of goalkeeper Simon Mignolet"
6170,"City extended their advantage just before the break when Mahrez was felled by Stanley Nsoki's late lunge inside the penalty area, and the Algeria international picked himself up off the turf to send Mignolet the wrong way and double his side's advantage at the break"
6171,"After combining with fellow substitute Raheem Sterling, the youngster produced a fine left-footed finish to beat Mignolet for just his second City goal"
6172,"Club Brugge finally had something to cheer late on when Hans Vanaken grabbed a late consolation (81) but it was the only blemish for City, who added a late fifth as Mahrez grabbed his second of the game (84) to put the finishing touch on a near-perfect night for Guardiola and his side as they look to secure top spot in Group A"
6173,"The home fans did eventually get something to cheer when Vanaken swept home from close range with just under 10 minutes remaining, but it proved to be only a consolation and there was even time for City to respond"
6174,"Van Dijk headed at goal, Andy Robertson shot over and sub Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain saw an effort saved as Liverpool looked to make their advantage count but Atletico's stubborn resilience was eventually undone by their own man, with Hermoso's reckless foul on Jota allowing Salah to capitalise"
6175,"In a clash that felt more like a decisive knockout tie than a group stage match, Liverpool raced into a two-goal lead, with Salah capping a wonderful dribble with a deflected drive past Jan Oblak (8) to score for the ninth game in a row, before Naby Keita crashed a superb volley home from a half-clearance"
6176,"The Frenchman turned in from close range after a corner (20) and then arrowed in his second (34) from the edge of the box, with Atletico benefitting from loose marking from Keita in the build-up to both goals"
6177,"First the currently untouchable Salah skipped past three Atletico defenders before his shot was diverted in off midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia, and then Keita - who scored a stunner against Crystal Palace earlier this season - hammered in another thumping volley from 20 yards"
6178,"Atletico had only lost one of their last 40 in all competitions at home before this clash, though, and it didn't take them long to hit back, with Lemar beating Keita too easily from a short corner before Koke's drive through a crowd of bodies was glanced in by Griezmann"
6179,Joao Felix was afforded too much space - with Keita again culpable - before finding Griezmann on the edge of the box and he was allowed by Van Dijk to touch and turn before firing into the bottom corner
6180,"Klopp acted during the interval to try to stem the flow of attacks by sending on Fabinho for Keita but was again thankful for his 'keeper, with Alisson stopping Carrasco's shot, after Sadio Mane's header had been tipped away at the other end"
6181,"But on 52 minutes Griezmann was shown a straight red for a high boot on Roberto Firmino and, although the 10 men of Atletico defended admirably, Salah (78) restored the visitors' lead from the penalty spot after a senseless shove from Mario Hermoso on Diogo Jota undid that good work"
6182,"But the contest changed dramatically seven minutes into the second half when Griezmann, watching a high ball come over him, caught Firmino in the face with a high boot and was shown a straight red card for dangerous play"
6183,"But on 52 minutes Griezmann was shown a straight red for a high boot on Roberto Firmino and, although the 10 men of Atletico defended admirably, Salah (78) restored the visitors' lead from the penalty spot after a senseless shove from Mario Hermoso on Diogo Jota undid that good work"
6184,"Jurgen Klopp's side almost squandered their position again when Jota leant into Jose Gimenez at a free-kick and sent the Atletico man tumbling but after a spot-kick was awarded, referee Daniel Siebert overruled his own decision from a pitchside monitor following a VAR check, infuriating the home fans inside the Wanda Metropolitano"
6185,"Van Dijk headed at goal, Andy Robertson shot over and sub Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain saw an effort saved as Liverpool looked to make their advantage count but Atletico's stubborn resilience was eventually undone by their own man, with Hermoso's reckless foul on Jota allowing Salah to capitalise"
6186,"There was more drama still to come, with Atletico's penalty award overturned, despite Jota making contact with his forearm on Gimenez's back, and Liverpool survived even a late Suarez shot, which flew just over, to earn their first ever win over the Spanish side at the fifth attempt"
6187,"Van Dijk headed at goal, Andy Robertson shot over and sub Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain saw an effort saved as Liverpool looked to make their advantage count but Atletico's stubborn resilience was eventually undone by their own man, with Hermoso's reckless foul on Jota allowing Salah to capitalise"
6188,"In a clash that felt more like a decisive knockout tie than a group stage match, Liverpool raced into a two-goal lead, with Salah capping a wonderful dribble with a deflected drive past Jan Oblak (8) to score for the ninth game in a row, before Naby Keita crashed a superb volley home from a half-clearance"
6189,"Disappointingly, there were boos from the home supporters before kick-off as Liverpool's players and Atletico's Kieran Trippier and Yannick Carrasco took a knee, but once play got underway the intensity of the early action lived up to what was otherwise an electric pre-game atmosphere"
6190,"Jurgen Klopp's side almost squandered their position again when Jota leant into Jose Gimenez at a free-kick and sent the Atletico man tumbling but after a spot-kick was awarded, referee Daniel Siebert overruled his own decision from a pitchside monitor following a VAR check, infuriating the home fans inside the Wanda Metropolitano"
6191,"However, it was Juventus that came the closest when Bernardeschi should have put the game out of sight only to bundle a chance wide in a rare Juve counter-attack that was started by a fantastic pass from Adrien Rabiot"
6192,"Jorginho, Hakim Ziyech and captain Cesar Azpilicueta were all hooked, in favour of Trevoh Chalobah, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Callum Hudson-Odoi in a bid to find a spark"
6193,There was still time for one last chance when Havertz rose to head a Chilwell over the bar from no more than 10 yards out
6194, Kai Havertz and Hakim Ziyech were the two chosen to provide the ammunition for Chelsea in Juventus but both played without spark or guile
6195, Ziyech was hooked on 60 minutes and Havertz seemed more comfortable playing alongside Lukaku for the final stages when Chelsea created their two best chances of the match
6196, Lukaku fired wide and Havertz headed over the bar
6197,"Jorginho, Hakim Ziyech and captain Cesar Azpilicueta were all hooked, in favour of Trevoh Chalobah, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Callum Hudson-Odoi in a bid to find a spark"

6199, Ziyech was hooked on 60 minutes and Havertz seemed more comfortable playing alongside Lukaku for the final stages when Chelsea created their two best chances of the match
6200,The one big Chelsea opening came and went late on as Romelu Lukaku fired wide after Chelsea finally provided him some fruitful service
6201, His team started in confident fashion with the ball and Lukaku flashed a shot straight at Wojciech Szczęsny after a well-worked corner
6202,"""""Romelu Lukaku was supposed to be the missing piece in the Chelsea jigsaw - and he probably still is"
6203,"""Chelsea are blessed with players that should be in their element playing off a striker like Lukaku"
6204, Ziyech was hooked on 60 minutes and Havertz seemed more comfortable playing alongside Lukaku for the final stages when Chelsea created their two best chances of the match
6205, Lukaku fired wide and Havertz headed over the bar
6206," Or perhaps Ross Barkley, who set up the late chance for Lukaku, can show Tuchel his best form?""Tuchel's selection in behind Lukaku for the clash with Southampton on Saturday will be a tricky one for the boss"
6207,"Jorginho, Hakim Ziyech and captain Cesar Azpilicueta were all hooked, in favour of Trevoh Chalobah, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Callum Hudson-Odoi in a bid to find a spark"
6208,"Jorginho, Hakim Ziyech and captain Cesar Azpilicueta were all hooked, in favour of Trevoh Chalobah, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Callum Hudson-Odoi in a bid to find a spark"
6209,Ross Barkley was thrown into the mix as well with time ticking down and created Chelsea's best chance of the match with seven minutes left
6210," Danjuma once again beat Diogo Dalot too easily down the left flank, with his cross flicked goalwards by the Spain forward"
6211," He then sent a spectacular first-time volley goalwards, with the ball bouncing in a spot of space before fizzing past Geronimo Rulli"
6212," He managed to poke the ball back for Ronaldo, who then slotted home past Rulli at the near post, wheeling away in a rapturous shirt-off celebration"
6213," But, soon after, Firmino (77) scored his first goal just 10 minutes after coming on as a substitute following a second error of the evening from Porto goalkeeper Diogo Costa"
6214,"But, in the 18th minute, it was Liverpool who took the lead after some superb work from Jones on the left, cutting inside before seeing his shot pushed away rather carelessly by Costa"
6215," His second on the rebound was then fired into the stands, but had Costa on the stretch"
6216, James Milner - filling in for the injured Trent Alexander-Arnold at right-back - sent a cross into the area which caught every Porto defender out and left Costa stranded in the six-yard box
6217,But the joy was short-lived as Costa made another calamitous error
6218," Sensing an opportunity, Firmino pumped the ball forward, leaving Costa racing after it"
6219,Porto were forced into a pre-match change when Pepe was injured in the warm-up and replaced by debutant Fabio Cardoso
6220," Jones fired from range, hitting the arm of Cardoso and falling into Firmino's path, and he duly scored"
6221," Zaidu Sanusi could not keep the ball under his control, with Salah lurking to roll the ball over the line"
6222," Vieira found himself in space down the right, sending in a superb cross that Taremi headed home after muscling himself in front of Joe Gomez"
6223," There was another enforced change inside 15 minute too as Otavio pulled his hamstring, and was substituted for Fabio Vieira"
6224," Vieira found himself in space down the right, sending in a superb cross that Taremi headed home after muscling himself in front of Joe Gomez"
6225," He cut into the area from the left, before laying the ball back for Vitinha - on loan at Wolves last season - but he sent his effort straight at Alisson"
6226,Porto were forced into a pre-match change when Pepe was injured in the warm-up and replaced by debutant Fabio Cardoso
6227, Porto had massive problems today - one centre-half out with a red card and then Pepe couldn't play
6228,Porto were given a glimmer of hope when Mehdi Taremi's low header beat Alisson in the 74th minute
6229," However, Porto did have the first effort of note when Luis Diaz's weak effort was held by Alisson at the near post"
6230,"Diaz was the brightest attacking spark for Porto in a limited first half, and he had another chance in the 38th minute, but his weak effort was an all-too-easy collection for Alisson"
6231," He cut into the area from the left, before laying the ball back for Vitinha - on loan at Wolves last season - but he sent his effort straight at Alisson"
6232," Vieira found himself in space down the right, sending in a superb cross that Taremi headed home after muscling himself in front of Joe Gomez"
6233,"With all eyes on PSG's formidable front three of Messi, Kylian Mbappe and Neymar it came as a surprise when the hosts took the lead through an unexpected source inside eight minutes, though the star-studded attack did all have a hand in the opener"
6234,"Messi found Achraf Hakimi, who released Mbappe to the byline from where his cutback saw Neymar fluff a shot from 12 yards and inadvertently present the ball to Gueye, who produced a clinical finish his attacking team-mates would have been proud of into the top corner of the Manchester City goal"
6235,"PSG spent the majority of the second half staunchly defending their area but gave City a reminder of their threat on the counter when Hakimi's pass released Neymar past a static defensive line, only for the pace of Kyle Walker to ensure the Brazilian could only fire into the side-netting"
6236,"PSG came close to doubling their lead on 38 minutes when Ander Herrera's drive was tipped over by Ederson and, from the resulting corner, Mbappe weaved into the area and drilled a teasing ball across the face of goal which none of his PSG team-mates had gambled to get on the end of"
6237,"PSG spent the majority of the second half staunchly defending their area but gave City a reminder of their threat on the counter when Hakimi's pass released Neymar past a static defensive line, only for the pace of Kyle Walker to ensure the Brazilian could only fire into the side-netting"
6238,"PSG went into the break with their noses in front but Sterling should have done better when presented with a chance to draw City level within two minutes of the restart, but he dragged a shot well wide of the PSG goal"
6239," Milan equalised from nowhere as Leao's pass split Matip and Joe Gomez to find Rebic, who wrapped his foot around the ball to finish low past Alisson"
6240,"The one-goal lead was still fragile as sub Olivier Giroud headed off target, while Alisson just cleared ahead of Milan's front line from a corner, but Liverpool held on"
6241,"Milan then settled slightly as Liverpool moved to a lower gear, but the chances continued to flow as Joel Matip headed a good opportunity at Maignan, and Salah's snap-shot from the edge of the box was tipped away brilliantly by the busy goalkeeper"
6242," Milan equalised from nowhere as Leao's pass split Matip and Joe Gomez to find Rebic, who wrapped his foot around the ball to finish low past Alisson"
6243,"But it was a rude awakening initially for the Italians as Liverpool camped in Milan's defensive third from the first minute; Andrew Robertson and Diogo Jota missed early half-chances, and they took the lead through brilliant combination play between Alexander-Arnold and Salah"
6244,"But they were let off the hook seconds after the restart as Simon Kjaer converted at the back post from a Jordan Henderson error at a corner, only for the offside flag to correctly go up, and it was soon 2-2"
6245,"Having played a one-two with Salah around an unsuspecting Rafael Leao, Alexander-Arnold skipped his way into the box on the right, looked to centre, and saw the ball deflect off Tomori and over goalkeeper Maignan for an own goal"
6246,"It should have been 2-0 moments later as Liverpool were awarded a penalty for a handball from Ismael Bennacer as he blocked Robertson's cross, but Salah's blasted penalty was saved by Maignan down the middle, before the Milan stopper reacted well to tip away Jota's headed rebound at close range"

7544,"Klopp cut an anxious figure as Roberto Firmino headed over from Alexander-Arnold's set piece, but he was celebrating moments later, albeit in fortuitous circumstances, as Fabianski inexplicably allowed Salah's shot from Andrew Robertson's low cross to squirm through his legs"

7557,"The hosts went 2-1 ahead through Aubameyang, converting coolly after being played through one-on-one with Jordan Pickford by Luiz's brilliant through ball, but Everton went into the half level as Richarlison pounced from close range to poke past Bernd Leno following some more sloppy Arsenal defending"
7558,"Arsenal were rocked, and it should have been two shortly after as Alex Iwobi fired over on the counter, but Sead Kolasinac's arm injury meant Saka was introduced, wonderfully setting up Nketiah for a close-range finish in-between the Everton centre-backs following a wicked left-wing cross"

7567,"After the break, Oli McBurnie should have restored the hosts' lead when he scuffed wide from six yards before glancing David McGoldrick's cross at Mat Ryan, but Brighton's solid defensive performance was enough to earn them a second point on the road in as many games, and keep their hosts four points behind fourth-placed Chelsea"
7568,"McBurnie would be left wondering how he had not added his name to the scoresheet with a succession of chances after the break - first a sliding effort that found the gloves of Ryan, after Jack O'Connell had deflected Oliver Norwood's corner into his path"
7569,"That owed more to his secondary job as an overlapping defender and twice he came close to assists for the hosts, setting up McBurnie twice after half-time - and with better finishing from his forward colleague, he would have got both"

7572,"While Spurs pulled one back late on when Erik Lamela's effort was deflected in by Antonio Rudiger (89), it could have been worse for the visitors had Giovani Lo Celso not been controversially let off by a VAR check when he appeared to stamp on Cesar Azpilicueta"
7573,"There were more debatable decisions to follow, as Tottenham had penalty appeals waved away when Tanguy Ndombele collided with Reece James and Harry Winks went down under Rudiger's challenge, while Chelsea could easily have made it three, with sub Tammy Abraham denied by a fine save by Lloris and Alonso hitting the bar with a free-kick"
7574,"Spurs had chances to get back level just before the break, with Lucas Moura's shot deflected over the bar by Azpilicueta and Davinson Sanchez forcing Willy Caballero to tip over from the resulting corner before Japhet Tanganga almost latched on to a long ball forward which had the Blues keeper back-tracking"

7614, Maguire - who could easily have been sent off by VAR in the first half for appearing to kick out at Batshuayi in an off-the-ball incident following a coming together in the Chelsea dugout - was given the freedom of the 18-yard box to charge in and head home a Bruno Fernandes corner
7615,"There was yet more VAR controversy in the Premier League encounter, however, and Chelsea will feel aggrieved Maguire did not see red when the game was still goalless after an incident with Michy Batshuayi, while substitute Kurt Zouma was denied an equaliser early in the second half"
7616,"Lampard was forced into a second change at half-time as Zouma came one for Andreas Christensen, and it looked as though the replacement centre-back had levelled when he fired in from a corner on 56 minutes, but VAR intervened to adjudge that Cesar Azplicueta had pushed Brandon Williams in the build-up - even though it appeared that Azpilicueta had himself been given a little shove by Fred to push him into United's young left-back"

7632,"Frustration began to creep into Liverpool's game as the first period drew to a close, but they re-emerged re-energised, with Naby Keita forcing a fingertip save from Tim Krul with a rasping drive on 57 minutes"

7651,Engels followed in Alderweireld's footsteps and redeemed himself by powering home a header from close range after a pin-point Grealish corner

7693,"Tottenham manager was left furious that Sterling had not been sent off for his 12th-minute challenge on Alli, and fumed to Sky Sports after the game that he felt consistency was lacking in the top flight"
7694,"He said: ""We can look at the perspective of being a bit lucky with a couple of situations where they hit the post or missed a good chance, but we can also see we were very unlucky the VAR didn't decide Sterling should have had a red card, which is clear"

7696,"Burnley's aggressive approach to regaining the ball high up the pitch contributed in them swinging the balance, but not before Nick Pope stood tall to deny Aubameyang's lofted finish from Granit Xhaka's pass - Arsenal's first shot on target at 37 minutes"
7697,"Aubameyang was then played onside by Charlie Taylor as he was found clean through on goal by David Luiz's measured long pass, but Arsenal's 16-goal top scorer showed signs of rustiness following his return from a three-game ban, slashing his right-foot shot horribly wide"

9092,"Chelsea began to find their flow, with Timo Werner sending a deflected shot wide after a good move down the right before Mason Mount crashed a free-kick into the side-netting - but Burn's flicked header wide from a follow-up cross from a corner was a warning for the home side"

9151,"""It took him a while to warm up with Klopp visibly encouraging him to track back after losing a duel with Tariq Lamptey"
9152,"Some of the highlights of his display was a 50-yard lung-bursting run back to nick the ball off Lamptey at the end of the first half and an equally as destructive 50-yard run forward that ended with a ridiculous pass to Salah, who should have doubled his tally for the afternoon"

9507,"Earlier, a Jan Bednarek own goal (18) had put Spurs in front but Southampton went on to dominate the rest of the first half and were unfortunate not to go into the break in front after Broja equalised with a low strike from a Romain Perraud cross (23)"

9533,"""Chelsea were profligate in the first period but found their shooting boots in the second - and in some style, as Ziyech's incredible curled effort flew past a stationary Hugo Lloris into the top corner (47), before Silva doubled the hosts' advantage and condemned Conte a first league defeat in charge of Spurs with a trademark glancing header (55)"
9534,Silva fired a header over from a corner soon after before Ziyech's rasping drive drew a rather unorthodox punch from Lloris in the Tottenham goal

9575,"While Shelvey's actual strike appeared to lack the power to really trouble Meslier in the Leeds goal, the France U21 international generously allowed his shot to squirm past him for the winner"
9576,Dan James was denied early on by an excellent reflex stop from Martin Dubravka as Jack Harrison - watched on from the stands by England boss Gareth Southgate - carried on where he left off at the London Stadium last weekend
9577,"That led to unwanted injuries to the likes of Joelinton, Paul Dummett and skipper Jamaal Lascelles, although the club's trip to Saudi Arabia for a warm-weather training camp may help to soothe some of those aches and pains ahead of their next clash at home to Everton on February 8"
9578,"In contrast, United had plenty of possession but were ponderous with it, failing to test league debutant Jonas Lossl before Diogo Dalot's speculative drive from distance swirled just wide"
9579,United were now in the mood and almost scored a quickfire second when Scott McTominay's piledriver was fielded unconvincingly around the post by Lossl
9580," Fred was afforded too much time to time his cross for the onrushing Elanga, who darted in front of Mads Roerslev to control and finish with his second touch"

9589,"Cristiano Ronaldo looked disgruntled as he was replaced by Rashford, but Rangnick's change was vindicated as the substitute's tidy finish from another Fernandes pass put the seal on an impressive second-half showing (77)"
9590,Ronaldo was instrumental as he chested the ball into the path of the onrushing Fernandes to dissect the entire Brentford defence
9591,"It was Rashford's first goal since October, ending an 11-game barren run, and Rangnick immediately turned to a disconsolate Ronaldo - the man whom he replaced to explain the reasoning behind the alteration"
9592,"Starting as the wide-left forward in a 4-2-3-1 system, Elanga combined most frequently with Alex Telles, McTominay, Raphael Varane and Ronaldo - contributing to the majority of United's attacks coming down his flank"
9593,"The volume of traffic seeking an escape intensified moments later when substitute Kucka diverted Idah's low cross beyond Bachmann at his near post to complete a miserable night for Watford, with Norwich now believing survival is within their grasp"
9594,"Ranieri described this meeting as a ""cup final"" but warned his side victory would not guarantee survival, and his team slowly shook off their sluggishness to carve open a few half chances; the impressive Samir headed over unmarked from Tom Cleverley's corner before fine footwork from Joao Pedro led to a snapshot into the gloves of Angus Gunn"
9595,"Kenny McLean gobbled up Christian Kabasele's poor clearance and while his pass seeking Teemu Pukki initially appeared over-hit, the striker was too strong for Samir and the Finland international crossed for Sargent to produce the most sensational of finishes with his heel as the ball looped back across goal and over the line via the crossbar"

9602,The Hornets needed no reminding heading the game it is now two months since they last won a match - the 4-1 home win over Manchester United - but it was the visitors who made the stronger start with Milot Rashica blasting a free-kick into the wall and another opportunity off target

9607, Not that Grealish played too much of a part in the fightback

9617,"United threw on Rashford, Cavani and Martial as they looked for a winner which would take them above West Ham and into fourth, but initially it was the Hammers who went closest in the closing stages as Tomas Soucek headed agonisingly wide and David de Gea pushed a deflected cross past the post"
9618,"""Fabinho's opener was nothing less than the home side deserved after putting Brentford under sustained pressure for most of the first half and forcing Fernandez into a brilliant stop from Virgil van Dijk after Jota and Trent Alexander-Arnold sent efforts over the bar early on"
9619,"Frustratingly for the midfielder, he was forced off with an injury soon after but a poor pass out from Fernandez allowed Roberto Firmino to pounce and tee up Minamino - 27 today - for a simple third meaning that, despite the absences of key men Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah, Liverpool just about keep City in sight"
9620,"The visitors appeared to have weathered the storm well and, with the help of some loose passes from Alexander-Arnold and Matip, caused some problems of their own as the half wore on, with Vitaly Janelt and Ivan Toney shooting off target"
9621,"Bryan Mbeumo had almost bent in an equaliser for Brentford on 58 minutes but was just falling away as he hit his shot after turning Joel Matip and, after Diogo Jota had hit the post and been denied by a super save from Alvaro Fernandez, Liverpool finally finished off the contest"

9630,But the trio could not inspire Chelsea to victory - Kovacic having the best effort as he lashed an effort wide - as the Blues missed the chance to keep some semblance of pace with Manchester City in first
9631,"West Ham again rallied to level a second time seven minutes into the second half through Pablo Fornals' well-taken strike but Harrison would complete his hat-trick in style, latching onto the impressive Raphinha's through ball to lift his finish over Lukasz Fabianski (60)"
9632,"The left-back hesitated and allowed Raphinha to chase and win a lost cause before setting up Mateusz Klich to force Fabianski to parry the ball into the path of Adam Forshaw, who unselfishly teed up Harrison for a crisp finish"
9633,Leeds could well have extended their lead before the break as Dan James was played through on goal by Raphinha but his shot was straight at Fabianski

9659,"Saint-Maximin came off the better as the pair tussled for the ball, driving into the area"

9730,Dennis was withdrawn at the break and replaced by Joao Pedro but Watford would come close to taking the lead against the run of play when Sema dispossessed Royal and set up King as his precise strike from the edge of the box was brilliantly tipped around the post by Lloris at full stretch

9734," But making the substitution at half-time, bringing Dennis off for Pedro, it made the difference"
9735,Dennis was withdrawn at the break and replaced by Joao Pedro but Watford would come close to taking the lead against the run of play when Sema dispossessed Royal and set up King as his precise strike from the edge of the box was brilliantly tipped around the post by Lloris at full stretch

9741,"As so often this term Watford hadn't heeded the warning in any case, as a slack pass out from Bachmann was gobbled up by the excellent Oliver Skipp to set up Kane"
9742," Yet there was little change upon the restart as after Reguilon's deflected strike rippled the side-netting, Kane renewed his battle with Bachmann with his left-footed dipper tipped over"

9753,"Vicente Guaita then produced a sensational double save to first deny Antonio's poke from close range, then Benrahma's return header while the Spaniard was on the floor"
9754,"Benrahma's delivery from the left was impossible for Palace's defenders, and needed only the faintest of touchest from Antonio to beat Guaita for the opener, only Antonio's second goal in nine appearances, but his 11th of the season so far"
9755,"West Ham had their tails up and scored again two minutes later; the dominant Declan Rice drove through midfield, spotted a gap that Lanzini occupied, and having turned inside Joachim Andersen, the ball jumped up perfectly for Lanzini to lash a brilliant volley past Guaita"
9756,"Lanzini tucked away a penalty late in the half after Luka Milivojevic handled just inside the box as he went to control the ball unopposed (45+5), a decision which infuriated Palace"
9757,"In looking to control the ball, Milivojevic instinctively handballed just inside the box, with VAR intervening and advising Darren England to check the pitchside screen"

9791,"There was little he could do about Brentford's next chance, however, as after Wissa had collected Ethan Pinnock's knockdown from the ensuing corner, his miscued shot bounced over both Ederson and Ivan Toney only for the ball to be glanced off the line by Cancelo"
9792,"The simmering tension between the two sets of players did lead to a flashpoint on the stroke of half-time, however, as Toney avoided punishment for appearing to place his studs on Fernandinho's shin as he lay on the ground having won a free-kick"

9799,"Those moments served as early warnings for Chelsea, but the first big opportunity fell their way when Brighton goalkeeper Robert Sanchez flapped at a corner and Cesar Azpilicueta steered the loose ball onto the post via a deflection"
9800,It was the same story in the 3-2 win over Leeds where two Jorginho penalties got them out of jail and papered over the cracks of their lack of cutting edge in the final third

12096,"However, the forward still had a lot to do to find the net from an acute angle, but his rising drive into the top right-hand corner of the goal left Filip Bednarek helpless at his near post"
12097,"Borna Barisic's floated free-kick into the area was headed goalwards by Connor Goldson, only for the defender's looping effort to beat Bednarek and strike the underside of the bar, with Hagi making sure by nodding home from on the line"

12101,Arsenal twice tested goalkeeper Rogers as the half wore on
12102," Cedric Sores sent a fierce drive his way from the top right of the area, but the Dundalk stopper just did enough to send it around the post before Maitland-Niles sent his own curling effort goalwards from range, but Rogers was across to save"

12111,"Celtic's formation, much analysed during the recent run of poor results, raised eyebrows early on; Ajer was at right-back behind Jeremie Frimpong in right midfield, in what looked like a 4-1-4-1 system, but as the half went on the Norwegian often dropped into a back three alongside Duffy and Jullien"
12112,"There was an alarming incident early on when Frimpong clattered headfirst into the advertising boards on the touchline as he cleared, but remarkably he stood up after a minute or so appearing to be unscathed"
12113," He then flicked it into the path of Frimpong, who had his feet swept from under him inside the box by Domagoj Bradaric in the act of shooting; it was enough to force the young Dutchman to leave the field, with Ewan Henderson replacing him"
12114,"The lead was regained three minutes later, thanks to the persistence of Klimala, who showed sharpness to burgle Xeka"

12122,"Two minutes and 13 seconds later, one became two, with the lively Barnes combining with the even livelier Luke Thomas down Leicester's left flank before seeing his driven shot deflect off Ionuț Nedelcearu past the wrong-footed Panagiotis Tsintotas in the AEK goal"

12125,"Vinicius should have put Spurs ahead before half-time when played through by Lucas Moura but shot straight at Alireza Beiranvand, before making amends with a tap-in 10 minutes into the second period after Gareth Bale's free-kick had been tipped onto the post"

12129,"Harry Kane, Heung-Min Son and Tanguy Ndombele were surprise additions from the bench moments later and the former had a hand in Spurs' second, feeding Lo Celso to slot in from a closing angle with 19 minutes to go"

12218,"A touch of fortune helped Iheanacho with both his goals, his first a bundled tap-in after 20 minutes when goalkeeper Matheus could not hold his heavy touch and allowed him a close-range finish, before a significant deflection off Bruno Viana saw his 25-yard drive beat the goalkeeper again two minutes into the second period"

12458,What might help Saka's cause is the emergence of Ben White as a reliable option at right-back
