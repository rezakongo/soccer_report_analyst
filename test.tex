\subsection{Step 1: Data Crawling}
At first we should find websites that include match reports and player's ratings of a match in a single pages. The best website for this is SkySport.

Results:

We should set ratings true if they are bigger than 6 and set false otherwise.

tokenized by sentences:
\csvautotabularcenter{../data/sentencebroken/result.csv}
tokenized by words:


\subsection{Step 3: Metrics}
For this section we should get most regular words, unique words of each reports and ... .
